# Task 1 - House Price Prediction
This repository contains a machine-learning model for predicting house prices using linear regression. The project demonstrates how to create a simple yet effective linear regression model in Python to estimate house prices based on various features such as the number of rooms, crime rate, accessibility to highways, and more, using the Boston Housing dataset.

# Dataset
The Amarillo Housing dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and includes information about various houses in Boston and their corresponding prices. It's often used for regression tasks and can be obtained from various sources, such as Kaggle.

#Linear Regression
Linear regression is a fundamental supervised machine learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous outcome or dependent variable (also known as the target variable) based on one or more independent variables (predictors or features). In the context of house price prediction, the goal is to estimate the price of a house (dependent variable) based on various features or characteristics of the house (independent variables).
